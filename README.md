#### Summary of data
- This data subset provided reports the health outcomes, preventive services, chronic disease-related health risk behaviors, disabilities and health status.
A filter was applied to focus on the data reported in California (CA)
- The variable "data_value" seems to report the % of the population in CA that is affected by asthma or diabetes, etc.
- the variable "totalpopulation" reports the number of reported individuals counted for the survey in that area

### Chi-Square Test
- This chi-square test was done with the "Data_Value" variable and "totalPopulation"
- There is a significant association between the data_value and totalPopulation.
### T-Test
- T-Test was done with the "Data_Value" and "totalPopulation" variable
- From the results, I am concluding that there is no significant difference between these two variables

### ANOVA
- I was having trouble with defining the variable I wanted to use as the health-related variable

### Regression Analysis
